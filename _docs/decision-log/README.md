# Decision Log
Decision logs are used to track key decisions that are made during the course of the project. These can be used at a later stage to understand why decisions were made and by whom.

You should add an entry to the decision log when you:
- Make a decision to use a specific technology which could have significant impact on how folks work in this repo
- Change a technology that was in use before, in favour of a new one
- Make a decision _not_ to use a technology for a specific reason
- Solve a problem in a way which may appear peculiar/confusing without wider context

## Log template
Save entry as `[YYYY-MM-DD]-[name-slug]` (for example `2022-02-15-deploy-pr-only.md`):

```md
# [Title]
