## Decision

We decided to switch to scripted migrations to make model changes more reliable and thus providing us more confidence doing bigger content model changes. Since the Voorhoede site was set up 5 years ago at the time of writing, the content modelling is also lacking a bit behind our current standards for content modelling. Therefore bigger content model changes are necessary.
