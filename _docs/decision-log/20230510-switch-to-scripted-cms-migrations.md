## Decision

We decided to switch to scripted migrations to make model changes more reliable, thus providing us with more confidence in performing large model changes. 
Since the Voorhoede site was set up 5 years ago, at the time of writing, the content modelling is also lacking behind our current standards.
Therefore, large content model changes are necessary for future development.
